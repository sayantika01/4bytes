## !! ABOUT THE PROJECT !!

<!-- VEDIO OR SCREENSHOT -->

### ðŸ’¡__INSPIRATION__ðŸ’¡
-	In the recent years the price of fuels has increased at a hight rate and there has been a great variation in price from place to place. Users are unaware about the distribution that are included in the retail price.
-	So we came up with this project to let the customers get a brief idea on the time to time and place to place variations in price of the fuels.
-	Usecase: For time flexibility: - When one is traveling across the the countries of Asia , he/she don't need to waste her time to find another website or app FOR the specific city/country , they can see the price from this website. So we can provide them a website where they can get to know about the prices and the distribution time to time hands-on.
-	Another usecase: In taxation: - The banking system is centralised. It is not [possible for a common people to get to know about the monetisation and taxation. We can thus provide them an overview about the tax included in the retail.
