## !! ABOUT THE PROJECT !!

<!-- VEDIO OR SCREENSHOT -->

### <b>💡__INSPIRATION__💡</b>
-	In the recent years the price of fuels has increased at a high rate and there has been a great variation in price from place to place. Users are unaware about the distribution that are included in the retail price.
-	So we came up with this project to let the customers get a brief idea on the time to time and place to place variations in price of the fuels.
-	<H3>Usecase: For time flexibility: -</H3> When one is traveling across the the countries of Asia , he/she don't need to waste her time to find another website or app FOR the specific city/country , they can see the price from this website. So we can provide them a website where they can get to know about the prices and the distribution time to time hands-on.
-	<H3>Another usecase: In taxation: -</H3> The banking system is centralised. It is not [possible for a common people to get to know about the monetisation and taxation. We can thus provide them an overview about the tax included in the retail.

### PROBLEMS THAT THIS PROJECT SOLVES:
- <H3>Consumer Awareness and Empowerment:</H3> Fluctuating fuel prices can impact consumers' budgets significantly. By providing real-time or regular updates on fuel prices, the project could help consumers make informed decisions about when and where to buy fuel, potentially saving them money.

- <H3>Market Transparency:</H3> Fuel prices can be subject to manipulation and lack of transparency. The project might aim to bring more transparency to fuel markets, discouraging price manipulation and ensuring fair pricing for consumers.

- <H3>Supply Chain Insights:</H3> Monitoring fuel prices could provide insights into the stability and efficiency of fuel supply chains. Any sudden changes in prices could be indicative of supply disruptions or geopolitical events affecting the energy market.

### 🔎OVERVIEW :🔍
•	In the landing page the user will come across three criteria to choose from:- 
    <br><b>o	FUEL TYPE</b></br>
    <br><b>o	COUNTRY NAMES</b></br>
    <br><b>o	CITY NAMES</b></br>
<br>•	On clicking on ‘Click here’ the user will be directed to a new tab where they will get to know about the prices and the corresponding graphs.</br>
<br>•	State-wise Price Comparison: The project will collect and display the current prices of petrol and diesel across different city in different states across the countries in Asia allowing users to compare prices easily.</br>
<br>•	Historical Price Trends: Users can view historical price variations through graphs and charts, helping them analyse the price fluctuations over the time.</br>

### 😢CHALLENGES FACED:😢
Since this is the first project, we faced a different types of challenges.
-	We faced problem in fetching data for the fuel prices.
-	We too faced a lot problem in the implementation of graphs corresponding to the data.
-	While working on it there was multiple errors to handle.
-	Going so far, in the case of readme I faced problem in previewing the image.

### 🎯FURTHER UPDATION ON THE PROJECT🎯
  <br>	We can add more features to enhance the site.</br>
  <br>	We can add more details on the prices and expand the area coverage under it.</br>
